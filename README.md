## Init Account & Nodes
1. Open your browser and sign up for an account at [Bless Network](https://bless.network/dashboard?ref=0F4X45).
2. After signing up, open the Developer Tools in your browser (press F12) and go to **Application > Local Storage**.
3. Look for the key `B7S_AUTH_TOKEN` and copy the corresponding `accessToken`, which will begin with `eyJ...`.
4. Install Node.js (v20.11.1 or your preferred version).
5. Edit the `crypto.js` file by replacing the `main()` function call with your copied `accessToken`, like this:

```javascript
main("Your AccessToken");
// Uncomment the following line to test hash generation:
// WTFTestHash(); // Test to create a hash
```

## Usage

1. Download and extract the files from [this link](#download).
2. Configure the `.json` file like the example below:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "token": "accessToken 1",
            "proxy": null
        },
        {
            "token": "accessToken 2",
            "proxy": "https://test:1234@example.com:8080"
        }
    ]
    ```

    - `proxy = null` disables proxy usage.

3. Run the program with the following command:

    ```bash
    bless-network.exe --init config.json
    ```

You can also add custom tags in the JSON for easier identification of your accounts, like so:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "name": "Account 1",
            "token": "accessToken 2",
            "proxy": "https://test:1234@example.com:8080"
        }
    ]
    ```

    - The `name` tag helps you identify accounts but does not affect the programâ€™s functionality.
